# Data requirements

This is a work in progress determining how to format data for upload.

* Do not include a header
* There can be no empty lines in the middle of the data. (A blank line at the end seems to be fine.)
* It currently doesn't care if the frequencies add up to one. (Working on that.)
* Haplotypes should be separated by tildas (~).

See demo_PHYCUS_HFs.csv for an example.
